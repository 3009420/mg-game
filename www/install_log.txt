1. create database and db user
2. Copy everything that is in /www onto the server's web root.
3. Goto /requirements and check that everything is ok
4. Make sure the following folder are empty and write able for the web server
/assets
/uploads
/protected/data
/protected/runtime

5. Make sure the file /protected/data/fbvsettings.php is writeable

6. open /protected/config/main.php and search for

  'db'=>array(
      'connectionString' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mg', //xxx set via installer
      'emulatePrepare' => true,
      'username' => 'root', //xxx set via installer
      'password' => '', //xxx set via installer
      'charset' => 'utf8',
      'tablePrefix'=>'', //xxx set via installer
    ),
  
  change this to match your settings. E.g
  
  'db'=>array(
      'connectionString' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mg', //xxx set via installer
      'emulatePrepare' => true,
      'username' => 'mg', //xxx set via installer
      'password' => 'mg1234?!', //xxx set via installer
      'charset' => 'utf8',
      'tablePrefix'=>'', //xxx set via installer
    ),
    
  SAVE the file
  
7. Goto the website and see it complain that the active record classes can't be found in the database (CHECK 1 system works)

8. Import the sql script /protected/data/mg.mysql.sql into your database 
  mysql -u dbuser -p databasename < mg.mysql.sql
  
9. Go back to site. Login as admin

The following user are at the moment automatically created

Login: admin
PWD: admin

Login: dbmanager
PWD: dbmanager 

Login: editor
PWD: editor

Login: player
PWD: player

10. Still everything working?

11. Goto admin tools

12. Use the import tools to upload some images into the system.  

13. Goto Games and select zentag update
14. Set zentag to active and check the all image set
15. Go back to arcade 
16. Choose Zentag and play ;-) 
  Note: everytime the system shows a previously not shown image it has to create resized versions. Future responses will be faster.
  Note: Yes, at the moment images can repeat. There are plans to omit that.
