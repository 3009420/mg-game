<h3>I'm going through the installer, and when I enter my admin account info and click submit, I'm brought back to the beginning of install process!</h3>

<hr />

<p>It's a PHP issue where you have to explicitly set the timezone. To fix this issue, add the following to your php.ini file:</p>

<pre><code>[Date]
date.timezone = "America/New_York"
</code></pre>

<p>(Substitute "New_York" with timezone of choice)</p>

<h3>I've registered for a player account, but I haven't received an email with my activation link.</h3>

<hr />

<p>Check your spam/junk folder to see if it got sent there. You can also contact the webmaster of your Metadata Games system to create a player account from the Manage Players page (admin / players).</p>

<h3>I've set up ZenTag, but I'm not scoring any points!</h3>

<hr />

<p>Check to make sure that you have the right combination of plugins enabled. If you don't have any point-generating plugins enabled, then the players won't get any points! This is what we suggest as the default settings for Zen Tag:</p>

<p>dictionary-StopWordPlugin
dictionary-WordsToAvoidPlugin
weighting-ScoreBySubjectMatterPlugin
weighting-ScoreNewMatchPlugin</p>

<h3>I've set up ZenTag, but I'm not scoring any points!</h3>

<p>Check to make sure that you have the right combination of plugins
enabled. If you don't have any point-generating plugins enabled, then
the players won't get any points!</p>
